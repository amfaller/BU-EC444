## Course Description

From [BU's Course Listing](https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-ec-444/): "Hands-on introductory course to cyber-physical and IoT systems. Microcontrollers: integrated development environments (ISEs), architecture, and I/O interfaces. Hardware interfacing of systems: formal design and specifications, real-time OS, programming, and control. IoT systems: smart phones, wireless personal area networks (WPANs), IP gateways, mobile cloud computing, reliability, security, and privacy. Course culminates with a team project."

As of now (December 2020), this course has been the most engineer-y course I've ever taken at Boston University. It covers the full stack, from backend hardware and network communication to front end data visualization and remote access. See lower level READMEs for contents.

Class taken in Fall 2020.
