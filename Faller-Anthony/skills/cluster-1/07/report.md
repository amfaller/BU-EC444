## Summary
I have created a program which will count up from 0-15 in binary and display this on a set of four LEDs. As per instructions, the LEDs were set in series with four 220-ohm resistors. I used pins 27, 33, 15, and 32 to represent the most significant bit through the least significant bit respectively.
