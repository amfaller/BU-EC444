#  Console I/O

## Summary
I have written a program which will:
	1. Toggle the onboard LED based on key input 't'
	2. Echo input (2 or more characters) from keyboard to console
	3. Echo decimal number input as hexadecimal
	4. Switch between the three modes based on key input 's'

I was unsure as to how to create a new esp-idf project, so I ended up copying the provided Blink program to a new directory.  I modified this code to include elements of the Console I/O Brief on the course website as well.
