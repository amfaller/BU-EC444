## Summary
I have connected the 14-segment display to the ESP32 and successfully created a program to write up to four ASCII symbols to the display. I based my code off of Emily Lam's I2C display example in the BU-EC444/code-examples repo, and copied the ASCII conversion array used in the adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack repo.
