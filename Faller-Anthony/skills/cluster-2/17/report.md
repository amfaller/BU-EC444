## Summary
I have created a series of files which creates a remote server, reads from a local file, pipes data to HTML, and displays a graph of said data using CanvasJS.

I struggled a lot with this skill, but Matt Boyd was able to meet with me today to help talk things through. He recommended I use the express module rather than the http module, and we worked through the data pipeline.
