# Code Readme

This folder contains four scripts for managing a MongoDB database. First, `initDB.js` creates the database. Then, `readAndAppend.js` reads the local CSV file and appends it to a collection. `query.js` then queries into the database to retrieve data. `drop.js` deletes the collection.

Requires `mongodb` and `csv-parser`
