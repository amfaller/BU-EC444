## Summary
Using the provided example code and hardware schematic, I have created a system of two IR Fobs to communicate current color. When a button is pushed, the fob's color is sent and the receiver fob color changes to match.

Due to limited breadboard space, some of the second fob's circuit is on the same board as the first fob.
