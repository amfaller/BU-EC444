## Summary
Working from an example provided by espressif, I created two modules to control LED brightness. One module accepts keyboard input to the console to toggle between one of ten possible brightnesses; the other automatically cycles through each brightness every 250ms. 

Links to demo videos are below, but the differences between higher brightnesses are a little difficult to see.
