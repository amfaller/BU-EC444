## Summary
Unfortunately, my accelerometer is not functioning properly. With special permission from Professor Little, I worked with my groupmates, Roger Ramesh and Shaivya Gupta, to realize the accelerometer skill for Quest 3; their repos likely have much more detailed information than mine does, because I was unable to do much of this skill myself.
